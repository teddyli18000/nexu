    a: "Anything you can describe in a conversation: build websites and tools (auto-deployed and live), analyze data and generate reports, write blogs and newsletters, run scheduled automations, conduct competitive research, and more. Just say what you need in Slack / Discord / Telegram / WhatsApp, and your lobster delivers it.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from ChatGPT / Claude?",
    a: "ChatGPT gives you answers. Nexu gives you results. The difference: 1) Your lobster lives in your IM — no extra window to open; 2) It doesn't just respond, it executes — code gets deployed, data analysis becomes a live dashboard; 3) It remembers your preferences — the more you use it, the smoother it gets; 4) It runs scheduled tasks automatically, without you having to watch.",
  },
  {
    q: "I don't know how to code. Can I still use it?",
    a: 'Absolutely. Just say "build me a ___" and your lobster handles all the technical details. For example, "build my daughter a vocabulary game" — it writes the code, deploys it, and gives you a link. You never touch a single line of code.',
  },
  {
    q: "Which chat apps are supported?",
    a: "Slack, Discord, Telegram, and WhatsApp. Each platform only needs a one-time bot setup — takes about 3 minutes. After that, 🦞 shows up in your group chats and DMs.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are the websites/tools it builds temporary?",
    a: "No. Every project is deployed to a unique URL that you can share with anyone. Pro plan supports custom domains and permanent hosting.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my data safe?",
    a: "Every user's code and data is fully isolated, running in an independent sandbox environment. We never access or use your data.",
